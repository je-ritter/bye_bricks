## Welcome to Bye Bricks!
- This was created using the code.thumby.us IDE.
- I cannot take full credit!! This game was original made for the Thumby by the folks at Thumby. I made this going through their tutorial.

### INSTRUCTIONS
- Use the d-pad to move your brick paddle left/right.
- Hit the ball and smash the bricks!
- Miss the ball? You lose!
